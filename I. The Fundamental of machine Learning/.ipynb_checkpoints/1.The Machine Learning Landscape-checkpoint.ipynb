    "### What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming cimputers so they can `learn from data.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a slightly more general definition:\n",
    "> [Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives cimputers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "                                                                      \n",
    "                                                                  Arthur Samuel, 1959\n",
    "\n",
    "And a more engineering-oriented one:\n",
    "> A computer program is said to learn from expirience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\n",
    "\n",
    "                                                                  Tom Mitchell, 1997\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, your spam filter is a Machine Learning program that can learn to flag spam given examples of spam emails (e.g., flagged by users) and examples of regular (nonspam, also called \"ham\") emails. The examples that the system uses to learn are called the `training set`. Each trainingexample is called a `training instance (or sample).` In the case, the task T is to flag spam for new emails, the experience E is the `training data`, and the performace measure P needs to be defined; for example, you can use the ratio of correctly classified emails. This particular performance measure is called `accuracy` and it is often used in classification tasks."

    "### Why Use Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider how you would write a pam filter using traditional prgramming techniques:\n",
    "1. First you would look at what spam typically looks like. You might notice that some words or phases (such as “4U,” “credit card,” “free,” and “amazing”) tend to come up a lot in the subject. Perhaps you would also notice a few other petterns in the sender's name, the email's body, and so on.\n",
    "2. You would write detection algorithm for each of the patterns that you noticed, and your program would flag emails as spam if number of these patterns are detected.\n",
    "3. You would test prgram, and repeat step 1 and 2 until it is good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/assets/mls2_0101.png\" style=\"width=500px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, if spammers notice that all their emails containing “4U” are blocked, they might start writing “For U” instead. A spam filter using traditional programming techniques would need to be updated to flag “For U” emails. If spammers keep working around your spam filter, you will need to keep writing new rules forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a spam filter based on Machine Learning techniques automatically notices that “For U” has become unusually frequent in spam flagged by users, and it starts flagging them without your intervention\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/assets/mls2_0102.png\" style=\"width=500px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another area where Machine Learning shines is for problems that either are too complex for traditional approaches or have no known algorithm. For example, consider speech recognition: say you want to start simple and write a program capable of distinguishing the words “one” and “two.” You might notice that the word “two” starts with a high-pitch sound (“T”), so you could hardcode an algorithm that measures high-pitch sound intensity and use that to distinguish ones and twos. Obviously this technique will not scale to thousands of words spoken by millions of very different people in noisy environments and in dozens of languages. The best solution (at least today) is to write an algorithm that learns by itself, given many example recordings for each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Machine Learning can help humans learn: algorithms can be inspected to see what they have learned (although for some algorithms this can be tricky). For instance, once the spam filter has been trained on enough spam, it can easily be inspected to reveal the list of words and combinations of words that it believes are the best predictors of spam. Sometimes this will reveal unsuspected correlations or new trends, and thereby lead to a better understanding of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying ML techniques to dig into large amounts of data can help discover patterns that were not immediately apparent. This is called data mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/assets/mls2_0103.png\" style=\"width=500px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, Machine Learning is great for:\n",
    "* Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better.\n",
    "* Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional approach: the best machine Learning techniques can perhaps find a solution.\n",
    "* Fluctuating environments: a amchine Learning system can adapt to new data.\n",
    "* Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data."

    "### Types of Machine Learning Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "There are so many different types of Machine Learning systems that it is useful to classify them in broad categories, based on the following criteria:\n",
    "* Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised, unsupervised, smiunsupervised, and reinforcement learning)\n",
    "* Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch learning)\n",
    "* Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead by detecting patterns in the training data and building a predictive model. much like scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "These criteria are not exclusive; you can combine them in any way you like. For example, a state-of-the-art spam filter may learn on the fly using a deep neural network model trained using examples of spam and ham; this makes it an online, model-based, supervised learning system."

    "#### # Supervised/Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning systems can be classified according to the amount and type of supervision they get during training. There are four major categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning, and Reinforcement Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ## SUPERVISED LEARNING\n",
    "\n",
    "In *supervised learning*, the training set you feed to the algorithm includes the disired solutions, called *labels*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/assets/mls2_0105.png\" style=\"width:500px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical supervised learning task is *classification*. The spam filter is a good example of this: it is trained with many example emails along with their *class* (spam or ham), and it must learn how to classify new emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another typical task is to predict a *target* numeric value, such as the price of a car, given a set of *features* (mileage, age, brand, etc.) called *predictors*. This sort of task is called *regression*. To train the system, you need to give it many examples of cars, including both their predictors and their labels (i.e., their prices).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** \n",
    ">> In Machine Learning an *attribute* is a data type (e.g., “Mileage”), while a *feature* has several meanings, depending on the context, but generally means an attribute plus its value (e.g., “Mileage = 15,000”). Many people use the words *attribute* and *feature* interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/assets/mls2_0106.png\" style=\"width:500px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that some regression algorithms can be used for classification as well, and vice versa. For example, *Logistic Regression* is commonly used for classification, as it can output a value that corresponds to the probability of belonging to a given class (e.g., 20% chance of being spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the most important supervised learning algorithms:\n",
    "* k-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "* Linear Regression\n",
    "* Logistic Regression\n",
    "* Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n",
    "* Decision Trees and Random Forests\n",
    "* Neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ## UNSUPERVISED LEARNING\n",
    "\n",
    "In *unsupervised learning*, as you might guess, the training data is unlabeled. The system tries to learn without a teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/assets/mls2_0107.png\" style=\"width:500px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "here are some of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms:\n",
    "* Clustering\n",
    "    * K-Means\n",
    "    * DBSCAN\n",
    "    * Hirarcical Clustering Analysis (HCA)\n",
    "* Anomaly detection and novelty detection\n",
    "    * One-class SVM\n",
    "    * Isolation Forest\n",
    "* Visualization and dimentionality detection\n",
    "    * Principal COmponent Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "    * Kernel PCA\n",
    "    * Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)\n",
    "    * t-distributed Stochastic neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\n",
    "* Association rule learning\n",
    "    * Apriori\n",
    "    * Eclat\n",
    "    \n",
    "For example, say you have a lot of data about your blog’s visitors. You may want to run a clustering algorithm to try to detect groups of similar visitors. At no point do you tell the algorithm which group a visitor belongs to: it finds those connections without your help. For example, it might notice that 40% of your visitors are males who love comic books and generally read your blog in the evening, while 20% are young sci-fi lovers who visit during the weekends. If you use a hierarchical clustering algorithm, it may also subdivide each group into smaller groups. This may help you target your posts for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/assets/mls2_0108.png\" style=\"width:500px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Visualization* algorithms are also good examples of unsupervised learning algorithms: you feed them a lot of complex and unlabeled data, and they output a 2D or 3D representation of your data that can easily be plotted. These algorithms try to preserve as much structure as they can (e.g., trying to keep separate clusters in the input space from overlapping in the visualization) so that you can understand how the data is organized and perhaps identify unsuspected patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/assets/mls2_0109.png\" style=\"width:500px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A related task is *dimensionality reduction*, in which the goal is to simplify the data without losing too much information. One way to do this is to merge several correlated features into one. For example, a car’s mileage may be very correlated with its age, so the dimensionality reduction algorithm will merge them into one feature that represents the car’s wear and tear. This is called feature *extraction*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **TIP:** \n",
    ">>It is often a good idea to try to reduce the dimension of your training data using a dimensionality reduction algorithm before you feed it to another Machine Learning algorithm (such as a supervised learning algorithm). It will run much faster, the data will take up less disk and memory space, and in some cases it may also perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another important unsupervised task is *anomaly detection*—for example, detecting unusual credit card transactions to prevent fraud, catching manufacturing defects, or automatically removing outliers from a dataset before feeding it to another learning algorithm. The system is shown mostly normal instances during training, so it learns to recognize them; and when it sees a new instance, it can tell whether it looks like a normal one or whether it is likely an anomaly. A very similar task is *novelty detection*: it aims to detect new instances that look different from all instances in the training set. This requires having a very “clean” training set, devoid of any instance that you would like the algorithm to detect. For example, if you have thousands of pictures of dogs, and 1% of these pictures represent Chihuahuas, then a novelty detection algorithm should not treat new pictures of Chihuahuas as novelties. On the other hand, anohttps://learning.oreilly.com/history/maly detection algorithms may consider these dogs as so rare and so different from other dogs that they would likely classify them as anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/assets/mls2_0110.png\" style=\"width:500px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, another common unsupervised task is association rule learning, in which the goal is to dig into large amounts of data and discover interesting relations between attributes. For example, suppose you own a supermarket. Running an association rule on your sales logs may reveal that people who purchase barbecue sauce and potato chips also tend to buy steak. Thus, you may want to place these items close to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ## SEMIUNSUPERVISED LEARNING\n",
    "\n",
    "Since labeling data is usually time-consuming and costly, you will often have plenty of unlabeled instances, and few labeled instances. Some algorithms can deal with data that’s partially labeled. This is called *semisupervised learning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some photo-hosting services, such as Google Photos, are good examples of this. Once you upload all your family photos to the service, it automatically recognizes that the same person A shows up in photos 1, 5, and 11, while another person B shows up in photos 2, 5, and 7. This is the unsupervised part of the algorithm (clustering). Now all the system needs is for you to tell it who these people are. Just one label per person, and it is able to name everyone in every photo, which is useful  for searching photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/assets/mls2_0111.png\" style=\"width:500px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Most semisupervised learning algorithms are combinations of unsupervised and supervised algorithms. For example, *deep belief networks* (DBNs) are based on unsupervised components called *restricted Boltzmann machines* (RBMs) stacked on top of one another. RBMs are trained sequentially in an unsupervised manner, and then the whole system is fine-tuned using supervised learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ## REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reinforcement Learning* is a very different beast. The learning system, called an *agent* in this context, can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and get *rewards* in return (or *penalties* in the form of negative rewards. It must then learn by itself what is the best strategy, called a *policy*, to get the most reward over time. A policy defines what action the agent should choose when it is in a given situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/assets/mls2_0112.png\" style=\"width:500px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, many robots implement Reinforcement Learning algorithms to learn how to walk. DeepMind’s AlphaGo program is also a good example of Reinforcement Learning: it made the headlines in May 2017 when it beat the world champion Ke Jie at the game of *Go*. It learned its winning policy by analyzing millions of games, and then playing many games against itself. Note that learning was turned off during the games against the champion; AlphaGo was just applying the policy it had learned."

    "#### # Batch and Online Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ## BATCH LEARNING\n",
    "\n",
    "In batch learning, the system is incapable of learning incrementally: it must be trained using all the available data. This will generally take a lot of time and computing resources, so it is typically done offline. First the system is trained, and then it is launched into production and runs without learning anymore; it just applies what it has learned. This is called offline learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a batch learning system to know about new data (such as a new type of spam), you need to train a new version of the system from scratch on the full dataset (not just the new data, but also the old data) the stop the old system and replace it with the new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the whole process of training, evaluating, and launching a Machine Learning system can be automated fairly easily, so even a batch learning system can adapt to change. Simply update the data and train new version of the system from scratch as often as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is simple and often works fine, but training using the full set of data can take many hours, so you would typically train a new system only every 24 hours or even just weekly. If your system needs to adapt to rapidly changing data (e.g., to predict stock prices), then you need a more reactive solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, training on the full set of data requires a lot of computing resources (CPU, memory space, disk space, disk I/O, network I/O, etc.). If you have a lot of data and you automate your system to train from scratch every day, it will end up costing you a lot of money. If the amount of data is huge, it may even be impossible to use a batch learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if your system needs to be able to learn autonomously and it has limited resources (e.g., a smartphone application or a rover on Mars), then carrying around large amounts of training data and taking up a lot of resources to train for hours every day is a showstopper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, a better option in all these cases is to use algorithms that are capable of learning incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ## ONLINE LEARNING\n",
    "\n",
    "In online learning, you train the system incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially, either individually or by small groups called mini-batches. Each learning step is fast and cheap, so the system can learn about new data on the fly, as it arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/assets/mls2_0113.png\" style=\"width:500px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Online learning is great for system that receive data as a continuous flow (e.g., stock prices) and need to adapt to change rapidy or autonomously. It is also goog option if you have limited computing resources: once an online learning system has learned about new data instances, it does not need them anymore, so you can discard them (unless you want to be able to roll back to a previous state and \"replay\" the data). This can save a huge amount of space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Online learning algorithms can also be used to train systems on huge datasets that cannot fit in one machine's mai memory (this is called *out-of-core* learning). The algorith loads part of the data, runs a training step on that data, and repeats the process until it has run all of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/assets/mls2_0114.png\" style=\"width:500px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "> **WARNING:** \n",
    ">> Out-of-core learning is usually done offline (i.e., not on the live system), so *onine learning* can be a confusing name. This of it as *increamental learning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important parameter of online learning systems is how fast they should adapt to changing data: this is called the *learning rate*. If you set a high learning rate, then your system will rapidly adapt to new data, but it will also tend to quickly forget the old data (you don’t want a spam filter to flag only the latest kinds of spam it was shown). Conversely, if you set a low learning rate, the system will have more inertia; that is, it will learn more slowly, but it will also be less sensitive to noise in the new data or to sequences of nonrepresentative data points (outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "A big challenge with online learning is that if bad data is fed to the system, the system’s performance will gradually decline. If we are talking about a live system, your clients will notice. For example, bad data could come from a malfunctioning sensor on a robot, or from someone spamming a search engine to try to rank high in search results. To reduce this risk, you need to monitor your system closely and promptly switch learning off (and possibly revert to a previously working state) if you detect a drop in performance. You may also want to monitor the input data and react to abnormal data (e.g., using an anomaly detection algorithm)."

    "One more way to categorize Machine Learning systems is by how they *generalize*. Most Machine Learning tasks are about making predictions. This means that given a number of training examples, the system needs to be able to generalize to examples it has never seen before. Having a good performance measure on the training data is good, but insufficient; the true goal is to perform well on new instances.\n",

The system would flag an email as spam if it has many words in common with a known spam email.\n",

You can either define a *utility function* (or *fitness function*) that measures how *good* your model is, or you can define a *cost function* that measures how *bad* it is. For linear regression problems, people typically use a cost function that measures the distance between the linear model’s predictions and the training examples; the objective is to minimize this distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the Linear Regression algorithm comes in: you feed it your training examples, and it finds the parameters that make the linear model fit best to your data. This is called training the model. In our case, the algorithm finds that the optimal parameter values are θ0 = 4.85 and θ1 = 4.91 × 10^–5.\n",

    "\n",
    "You are finally ready to run the model to make predictions. For example, say you want to know how happy Cypriots are, and the OECD data does not have the answer. Fortunately, you can use your model to make a good prediction: you look up Cyprus’s GDP per capita, find $22,587, and then apply your model and find that life satisfaction is likely to be somewhere around 4.85 + 22,587 × 4.91 × 10^-5 = 5.96."

    "Machine Learning is not quite there yet; it takes a lot of data for most Machine Learning algorithms to work properly. Even for very simple problems you typically need thousands of examples, and for complex problems such as image or speech recognition you may need millions of examples (unless you can reuse parts of an existing model).\n",

    "#### # Nonrepresentative Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to generalize well, it is crucial that your training data be representative of the new cases you want to generalize to. This is true whether you use instance-based learning or model-based learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the set of countries we used earlier for training the linear model was not perfectly representative; a few countries were missing. Figure below shows what the data looks like when you add the missing countries.\n",

As you can see, not only does adding a few missing countries significantly alter the model, but it makes it clear that such a simple linear model is probably never going to work well. It seems that very rich countries are not happier than moderately rich countries (in fact they seem unhappier), and conversely some poor countries seem happier than many rich countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a nonrepresentative training set, we trained a model that is unlikely to make accurate predictions, especially for very poor and very rich countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to use a training set that is representative of the cases you want to generalize to. This is often harder than it sounds: if the sample is too small, you will have *sampling noise* (i.e., nonrepresentative data as a result of chance), but even very large samples can be nonrepresentative if the sampling method is flawed. This is called *sampling bias*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### # Poor-Quality Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, if your training data is full of errors, outliers, and noise (e.g., due to poor-quality measurements), it will make it harder for the system to detect the underlying patterns, so your system is less likely to perform well. It is often well worth the effort to spend time cleaning up your training data. The truth is, most data scientists spend a significant part of their time doing just that. The following are a couple of examples of when you’d want to clean up training data:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### # Irrelevant Features\n",
    "\n",
    "As the saying goes: garbage in, garbage out. Your system will only be capable of learning if the training data contains enough relevant features and not too many irrelevant ones. A critical part of the success of a Machine Learning project is coming up with a good set of features to train on. This process, called *feature engineering*, involves the following steps:\n",

Overgeneralizing is something that we humans do all too often, and unfortunately machines can fall into the same trap if we are not careful. In Machine Learning this is called *overfitting*: it means that the model performs well on the training data, but it does not generalize well.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Complex models such as deep neural networks can detect subtle patterns in the data, but if the training set is noisy, or if it is too small (which introduces sampling noise), then the model is likely to detect patterns in the noise itself. Obviously these patterns will not generalize to new instances. For example, say you feed your life satisfaction model many more attributes, including uninformative ones such as the country’s name. In that case, a complex model may detect patterns like the fact that all countries in the training data with a w in their name have a life satisfaction greater than 7: New Zealand (7.3), Norway (7.4), Sweden (7.2), and Switzerland (7.5). How confident are you that the w-satisfaction rule generalizes to Rwanda or Zimbabwe? Obviously this pattern occurred in the training data by pure chance, but the model has no way to tell whether a pattern is real or simply the result of noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **WARNING**\n",
    ">> Overfitting happens when the model is too complex relative to the amount and noisiness of the training data. Here are possible solutions:\n",
    ">> * Simplify the model by selecting one with fewer parameters (e.g., a linear model rather than a high-degree polynomial model), by reducing the number of attributes in the training data or by constraining the model.\n",
    ">> * Gather more training data.\n",
    ">> * Reduce the noise in the training data (e.g., fix data errors and remove outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraining a model to make it simpler and reduce the risk of overfitting is called *regularization*. For example, the linear model we defined earlier has two parameters, θ0 and θ1. This gives the learning algorithm two degrees of freedom to adapt the model to the training data: it can tweak both the height (θ0) and the slope (θ1) of the line. If we forced θ1 = 0, the algorithm would have only one degree of freedom and would have a much harder time fitting the data properly: all it could do is move the line up or down to get as close as possible to the training instances, so it would end up around the mean. A very simple model indeed! If we allow the algorithm to modify θ1 but we force it to keep it small, then the learning algorithm will effectively have somewhere in between one and two degrees of freedom. It will produce a simpler model than with two degrees of freedom, but more complex than with just one. You want to find the right balance between fitting the training data perfectly and keeping the model simple enough to ensure that it will generalize well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure below shows three models. The dotted line represents the original model that was trained on the countries represented as circles (without the countries represented as squares), the dashed line is our second model trained with all countries (circles and squares), and the solid line is a model trained with the same data as the first model but with a regularization constraint. You can see that regularization forced the model to have a smaller slope: this model does not fit the training data (circles) as well as the first model, but it actually generalizes better to new examples that it did not see during training (squares).\n",

    "\n",
    "The amount of regularization to apply during learning can be controlled by a *hyperparameter*. A hyperparameter is a parameter of a learning algorithm (not of the model). As such, it is not affected by the learning algorithm itself; it must be set prior to training and remains constant during training. If you set the regularization hyperparameter to a very large value, you will get an almost flat model (a slope close to zero); the learning algorithm will almost certainly not overfit the training data, but it will be less likely to find a good solution. Tuning hyperparameters is an important part of building a Machine Learning system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### # Underfitting the Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might guess, underfitting is the opposite of overfitting: it occurs when your model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data. For example, a linear model of life satisfaction is prone to underfit; reality is just more complex than the model, so its predictions are bound to be inaccurate, even on the training examples.\n",
    "* Here are the main options for fixing this problem:\n",
    "* Select a more powerful model, with more parameters.\n",
    "* Feed better features to the learning algorithm (feature engineering).\n",

If the algorithm is model-based, it tunes some parameters to fit the model to the training set (i.e., to make good predictions on the training set itself), and then hopefully it will be able to make good predictions on new cases as well. If the algorithm is instance-based, it just learns the examples by heart and generalizes to new instances by using a similarity measure to compare them to the learned instances.\n",

    "### Testing and Validating\n",
    "\n",
    "The only way to know how well a model will generalize to new cases is to actually try it out on new cases. One way to do that is to put your model in production and monitor how well it performs. This works well, but if your model is horribly bad, your users will complain—not the best idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better option is to split your data into two sets: the *training* set and the *test* set. As these names imply, you train your model using the training set, and you test it using the test set. The error rate on new cases is called the generalization error (or out-of-sample error), and by evaluating your model on the test set, you get an estimate of this error. This value tells you how well your model will perform on instances it has never seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the training error is low (i.e., your model makes few mistakes on the training set) but the generalization error is high, it means that your model is overfitting the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **TIP**\n",
    ">> It is common to use 80% of the data for training and hold out 20% for testing. However, this depends on the size of the dataset: if it contains 10 million instances, then holding out 1% means your test set will contain 100,000 instances, probably more than enough to get a good estimate of the generalization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### # Hyperparameter Tuning and Model selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating a model is simple enough: just use a test set. But suppose you are hesitating between two types of models (say, a linear model and a polynomial model): how can you decide between them? One option is to train both and compare how well they generalize using the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose that the linear model generalizes better, but you want to apply some regularization to avoid overfitting. The question is, how do you choose the value of the regularization hyperparameter? One option is to train 100 different models using 100 different values for this hyperparameter. Suppose you find the best hyperparameter value that produces a model with the lowest generalization error, say, just 5% error.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you launch this model into production, but unfortunately it does not perform as well as expected and produces 15% errors. What just happened?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that you measured the generalization error multiple times on the test set, and you adapted the model and hyperparameters to produce the best model for that particular set. This means that the model is unlikely to perform as well on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common solution to this problem is called *holdout validation*: you simply hold out part of the training set to evaluate several candidate models and select the best one. The new heldout set is called the validation set (or sometimes the development set, or dev set). More specifically, you train multiple models with various hyperparameters on the reduced training set (i.e., the full training set minus the validation set), and you select the model that performs best on the validation set. After this holdout validation process, you train the best model on the full training set (including the validation set), and this gives you the final model. Lastly, you evaluate this final model on the test set to get an estimate of the generalization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution usually works quite well. However, if the validation set is too small, then model evaluations will be imprecise: you may end up selecting a suboptimal model by mistake. Conversely, if the validation set is too large, then the remaining training set will be much smaller than the full training set. Why is this bad? Well, since the final model will be trained on the full training set, it is not ideal to compare candidate models trained on a much smaller training set. It would be like selecting the fastest sprinter to participate in a marathon. One way to solve this problem is to perform repeated cross-validation, using many small validation sets. Each model is evaluated once per validation set after it is trained on the rest of the data. By averaging out all the evaluations of a model, we get a much more accurate measure of its performance. There is a drawback, however: the training time is multiplied by the number of validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### # Data Mismatch\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, it’s easy to get a large amount of data for training, but this data probably won’t be perfectly representative of the data that will be used in production. For example, suppose you want to create a mobile app to take pictures of flowers and automatically determine their species. You can easily download millions of pictures of flowers on the web, but they won’t be perfectly representative of the pictures that will actually be taken using the app on a mobile device. Perhaps you only have 10,000 representative pictures (i.e., actually taken with the app). In this case, the most important rule to remember is that the validation set and the test must be as representative as possible of the data you expect to use in production, so they should be composed exclusively of representative pictures: you can shuffle them and put half in the validation set and half in the test set (making sure that no duplicates or near-duplicates end up in both sets). After training your model on the web pictures, if you observe that the performance of your model on the validation set is disappointing, you will not know whether this is because your model has overfit the training set, or whether this is just due to the mismatch between the web pictures and the mobile app pictures. One solution is to hold out part of the training pictures (from the web) in yet another set that Andrew Ng calls the train-dev set. After the model is trained (on the training set, not on the train-dev set), you can evaluate it on the train-dev set. If it performs well, then the model is not overfitting the training set. If it performs poorly on the validation set, the problem must be coming from the data mismatch. You can try to tackle this problem by preprocessing the web images to make them look more like the pictures that will be taken by the mobile app, and then retraining the model. Conversely, if the model performs poorly on the train-dev set, then the model must have overfit the training set, so you should try to simplify or regularize the model, get more training data, and clean up the training data."
